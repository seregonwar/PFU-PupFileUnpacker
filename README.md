## Features

- Extracts all files and metadata from PUP archives
- Prints extensive details about the package contents, including:
- Firmware version
- Number of files contained
- Installation instructions
- File paths
- File sizes
- SHA-256 hashes
- Intuitive GUI to select PUP files to unpack
- Saves extracted files to output directory
- Actively maintained and open source

## Usage

### Dependencies

PFU requires Python 3 and the following modules:

- tkinter
- struct
- lzma
- pycryptodome

Install dependencies with:

```bash
pip install tkinter struct lzma pycryptodome
```

### Basic Usage

1. Clone the GitHub repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/seregonwar/Pup-file-extractor.git
```
2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
3. Run the script with:
```bash
python pup_unpacker.py
```
4. Use the dialog to select a PUP file.
5. The content will be extracted to your working directory.

### Advanced Usage

The `pup_unpacker.py` script has extensive documentation on all functions and classes. Developers can easily integrate the PUP extraction functionality into their applications.

See the [wiki](https://github.com/seregonwar/Pup-file-extractor/wiki) for more usage details.

## Project Structure

- `pup_unpacker.py`: Main GUI script to select and extract PUP files.
- `pup_decrypt_tool.py`: Tool to decrypt PUP files.
- `ps4_dec_pup_info.py`: Module to extract information from decrypted PUP files.
- `pup_module.py`: Module to manage the PUP file extraction logic.
- `Pupfile.py`: Module to read and interpret PUP files.

## Credits

The PUP extraction logic was adapted from [ps4_dec_pup_info](https://github.com/SocraticBliss/ps4_dec_pup_info) by [SocraticBliss](https://github.com/SocraticBliss).

## State of development 
The development of this software is currently at a standstill. The code is complete and partially fulfills its intended functionality, but I am seeking a way to decrypt all update files encrypted with AES-256. The PFU feature is finished, but it cannot fully and properly extract the files. If I had access to Sonyâ€™s encryption keys and integrated them into the code, the decryption process would be much simpler. I will continue to release patches to address any bugs.
